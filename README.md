# üèïÔ∏è Camping & Travel App (Wander Nest)

A cross-platform Flutter application focused on helping campers discover individual, unique camping sites across various regions. 

The app will allow users to:

- Browse and filter a list of campsites by key attributes such as amenities, price & host languages
- View detailed information about each campsite
